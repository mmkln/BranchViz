# BranchViz

BranchViz is a project management visualization library that uses a branch and timeline concept, similar to GitGraph, to help users visualize their projects, tasks, and milestones.

## Features

- **Branch Visualization:** Create and visualize project branches to represent different workflows, tasks, or phases.
- **Task Management:** Add tasks to each branch, track their status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Milestone Tracking:** Define and visualize important project milestones on the timeline.
- **Framework Integration:** Supports integration with popular frontend frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular.
- **Customization:** Easily customizable to fit different project needs and visual styles.
- **Interactivity:** Provides an interactive UI for adding, editing, and managing branches, tasks, and milestones.

## Installation

To install BranchViz, use npm:

```bash
npm install branchviz
```
````

## Usage

Below is a simple example of how to use BranchViz in your project. This example shows how to create a basic graph with branches, tasks, and milestones:

```javascript
import Graph from 'branchviz';

const graph = new Graph('graph-container');
const mainBranch = graph.addBranch('Main Project');
graph.addTaskToBranch('Main Project', 'Initial Planning');
graph.addTaskToBranch('Main Project', 'Design Phase');
graph.addMilestoneToBranch(
  'Main Project',
  'Kickoff Meeting',
  new Date('2024-01-15')
);

graph.render();
```

### Step-by-step Guide

1. **Setup:** Include BranchViz in your project by installing it via npm.

2. **Initialize Graph:** Create a new `Graph` object by specifying the container element's ID where the graph should be rendered.

3. **Add Branches:** Use `addBranch()` to create branches representing different aspects or phases of your project.

4. **Add Tasks and Milestones:** Use `addTaskToBranch()` and `addMilestoneToBranch()` to add tasks and milestones to specific branches.

5. **Render:** Call `render()` to visualize the graph in the specified container.
